  <h1>First post</h1>
<p>Hello world, today I learned many things. The first thing that I learned that I want to bring attention to is that The Book Depository, an online bookstore which I thought was independent of Amazon, was acquired by <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/help/topic/HelpId/54/How-does-the-Amazon-acquisition-affect-The-Book-Depository-customers#helpContent">Amazon back in 2011</a>.</p>
<p>The fact that this is not so well known tells you what Amazon is trying to do here.</p>
<p>I also learned a little about Eleventy, evident of this blog post. I spent too much time last week trying to set this up via gh-pages, and for some reason was getting a 404 even though it all seemed fine to me. I gave up with Github Pages and tried to set it up with Netlify instead, and literally 5 minutes later, the site was up and running. Good stuff.</p>
<p>I learned some French via Duolingo, and I also learned another a way to say &quot;no question&quot; in Japanese (though a bit vulgar): 愚問 (ぐもん), gumon...&quot;dumb question&quot;.</p>
<p>Continuing, I learned a lot about <a href="https://phaser.io">Phaser</a> and game making in general, even though I'm trying to make a game bit by bit. In particular, I'm trying to replicate a game my wife plays often, called &quot;drop the number&quot;. It's a generic game were the goal is to last as long as possible by dropping blocks which have a number. Similar to tetris, but the blocks only &quot;dissapear&quot; when they connect with another block of the same number.</p>
<img width="200" src="/img/first_post/blocks.png" alt="Screenshot of progress of my blocks game. A few blocks with numbers 16, 2, 256 and 32 lay scattered in a white screen" />
<p>I will probably have to take some time later to record the perhaps interesting ways that I have attempted to recreate this game, at least once its done.</p>
<p>Next: I'd like to continue learning about Eleventy, Phaser, French, and Japanese. I'd also like to continue working on learning scales better.</p>
