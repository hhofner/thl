  <p>Did you know that Hamsters have a heart rate of 400bpm? Neither did I, and that's actually very impressive when you consider a humans average resting heart rate is 72.</p>
<p>I've heard this idea that humans, and animals in general, have a set amount of heart beats. It sounds like it makes sense, if you consider us to be like machines.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this silly idea doesn't entirely hold true, because then otherwise athletes as a whole would die earlier (since they do more exercise than an average person does, thus quickly depleting their heart beats).</p>
<p>At least, according to this research article, it doesn't hold true:<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-020-01379-5">Health Consequences of an Elite Sporting Career: Long-Term Detriment or Long-Term Gain? A Meta-Analysis of 165,000 Former Athletes</a></p>
<p>But this brings me to my main point, Sloths have a heart beat of around 20bpm, maybe higher, that paired with the idea that Sloths try to conserve as much energy as possible, I expected them to live longer. Unfortunately, they live about 20 years, which I found to be a bit short.</p>

<p>I learned that if you'd like to access the store of a module in a Vuex store, via the object that is created from the Vuex constructor, you do it via the state attribute and not from the modules. In other words:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const store = Vuex.Store({...})

// Not this
const stateIWant = store.modules.someModule.state

// But like this
const stateIWant = store.state.someModule

</code></pre>

<p>I often find myself bouncing between Sublime Text, VSCode and Neovim.</p>
<p>You'd think Sublime Text is a good middle ground, and it is in most cases, but not always.</p>
