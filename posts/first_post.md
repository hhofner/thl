# First post

Hello world, today I learned many things. The first thing that I learned that I want to bring attention to is that The Book Depository, an online bookstore which I thought was independent of Amazon, was acquired by [Amazon back in 2011](https://www.bookdepository.com/help/topic/HelpId/54/How-does-the-Amazon-acquisition-affect-The-Book-Depository-customers#helpContent).

The fact that this is not so well known tells you what Amazon is trying to do here. 

I also learned a little about Eleventy, evident of this blog post. I spent too much time last week trying to set this up via gh-pages, and for some reason was getting a 404 even though it all seemed fine to me. I gave up with Github Pages and tried to set it up with Netlify instead, and literally 5 minutes later, the site was up and running. Good stuff.

I learned some French via Duolingo, and I also learned another a way to say "no question" in Japanese (though a bit vulgar): 愚問 (ぐもん), gumon..."dumb question". 

Continuing, I learned a lot about [Phaser](https://phaser.io) and game making in general, even though I'm trying to make a game bit by bit. In particular, I'm trying to replicate a game my wife plays often, called "drop the number". It's a generic game were the goal is to last as long as possible by dropping blocks which have a number. Similar to tetris, but the blocks only "dissapear" when they connect with another block of the same number.

I will probably have to take some time later to record the perhaps interesting ways that I have attempted to recreate this game, at least once its done.

Next: I'd like to continue learning about Eleventy, Phaser, French, and Japanese. I'd also like to continue working on learning scales better.
