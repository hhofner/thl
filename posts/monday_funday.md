- Learned today that the biggest state in the US is Alaska. First thought off the top of my head was Texas. 

And I was off by a big margin, as [Alaska is 586,000 square miles](https://www.yahoo.com/gma/biggest-state-us-states-largest-140006272.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9kdWNrZHVja2dvLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEcVMaoHpIXcXPENG5IVXTdzyJQoOxNIIY5j9C6sw8Ms6ozMVF5rXOETqQxRBcYmlsirJAeJMYono0K16ixR9xilc2d_a_bQnBOA54zP5jZoIZOMU1rlAkoCCDVzRN0WHNZT8q61JkWZ6JXnIGqYWS7DZD8VCkhDMR_LeohyTtGr) and Texas about half of that.

- Learned that Vue 2 has a property in which you can define text formatting filters as such:

```javascript
filters: {
	capitalize: function (value) {...}
}
```

This has however, been discontinued in Vue 3.
